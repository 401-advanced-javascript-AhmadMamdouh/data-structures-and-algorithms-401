## ll-zip
make one Linked list useng tow linked lists.

## Challenge
to make function (zip) which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.



## Approach & Efficiency
I use while loop to go over all nodes to change the time for searching , Also use the classes and constructor .

## big O :
append : space O(1) , time O(1) ,----> as it's one oppration.
loop : space O(n) , time O(1),------> This is because the loop has a complexity O(n) and it is run n times.

## solution : see attached images
